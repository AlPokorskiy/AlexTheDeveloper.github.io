								<p>
									Hi there, my name is Alex Pokorskiy, 
									I am a freshly graduated student from Bow Valley College under the Software developer program and 
									I am now aspiring to enter the field of software engineering and programming While working in the IT for the last 2 years my main aspiration is to become a software engineer, 
									for that purpose I have continued my studies outside of school by focusing on a programming languages such as Python and Java. 
									In this portfolio you will find my projects that I have worked on using Python and many of its libraries and add-ons. 
									While its all well and good to have projects and technical ability, I also want to state that my overall computer science knowledge and general knowledge of coding languages will be of great help to any projects that come my way. 
									I tend to be a quick learner and can be flexible with the work that is given to me when it comes to information retrieval from any kind of database such as Oracle, MySQL, or MongoDB. I am very adamant for proper technical documentation of all work I do right down to what software design 
									methodologies were used in creation of the project and its attributed systems and what code optimization methods were used in the project. 
									I also posses great communication skills and the ability to work in a collaborative environment along with other members of my team. 
									I like to approach my project in a creative problem solving fashion and actively learning new ways of working on my 
									current and future projects.
